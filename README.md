# cos-sim
This is a fork of the traffic simulator that can be found at http://code.google.com/p/cos-sim

## Goal
The objective is to extend the simulator in order to:

1. extend choices of driving models
2. implement vehicular communication (V2V and V2I)
3. allow usage of cooperative intersection management
4. implement a deadlock-free policy for the road network

## Current work
Implementation of different driving models
